<h2>Usage<a name="Usage"></a></h2>
<p>Although AEM Monitoring provides several types monitoring of out of the box, adding custom integrations is simple. The primary service interface for recording metrics is <a href="../core/src/main/java/com/icfolson/aem/monitoring/core/service/MonitoringService.java">MonitoringService</a>. Callers can leverage this service to record events, metrics, and counters:</p>

<h2>Limits<a name="Limits"></a></h2>
<p>The included test bundle generates a consistent configurable load. The default settings will generate: - 60 seconds of consistent events - at 100 events per seconds (6,000 events) - each event 10 string properties and 2 numeric properties (72,000 property instances)</p>
<p>This test has been extended to as many as 100K events over an hour, with minimal CPU or memory load witnessed, although this rate does use roughly 50M of disk space during that hour. For that reason, it is recommended that you design each event such that they will be fired less than 500K times per day, and that adequate disk space be considered during development/deployment. Some other limits include: - Names (for events, event properties, metrics, and counters) should be limited to 200 characters - Values for event properties are either strings less that 4000 characters, or floating-point values - Metric values are floating-point values - Counter increments are 64-bit integers (but default to 1) - System properties (constant values representing a system of origin) have the same limitations as event properties</p></div>

<h2>Extension Points<a name="Extension_Points"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>No configuration required for adding new data categories &#x2013; just code and go</li>
  
<li>Modify/filter/augment monitoring data via the MonitoringFilter service interface</li>
  
<li>Send monitoring data to a custom endpoint via the MonitoringWriter service interface</li>
  
<li>Add custom properties to each system of origin to simplify querying</li>
  
<li>Database is available for custom queries: add reporting, alarms, etc.</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Limits<a name="Limits"></a></h2>
<p>The included test bundle generates a consistent configurable load. The default settings will generate: - 60 seconds of consistent events - at 100 events per seconds (6,000 events) - each event 10 string properties and 2 numeric properties (72,000 property instances)</p>
<p>This test has been extended to as many as 100K events over an hour, with minimal CPU or memory load witnessed, although this rate does use roughly 50M of disk space during that hour. For that reason, it is recommended that you design each event such that they will be fired less than 500K times per day, and that adequate disk space be considered during development/deployment. Some other limits include: - Names (for events, event properties, metrics, and counters) should be limited to 200 characters - Values for event properties are either strings less that 4000 characters, or floating-point values - Metric values are floating-point values - Counter increments are 64-bit integers (but default to 1) - System properties (constant values representing a system of origin) have the same limitations as event properties</p></div>

<h2>Monitoring Data Types<a name="Monitoring_Data_Types"></a></h2>
<p>AEM Monitoring provides multiple means of capturing analytics info. Each type has different storage and visualization options. Events are a collection of key/value pairs, metrics are real values, and counters are integers. All types are defined by a qualified name and a timestamp.</p></div>$htmlTool.replaceAll( $bodyContent, $iconReplacements )#set$shortTitleGenerated#set$hTexts$htmlTool.text( $bodyContent, "h1" )UTF-8aem-monitoring - en#set$protocol#set$resourcePath.#set$bootstrapCssPath$resourcePath#set$bootstrapCssResponsivePath$bootstrapCssPath#set$bootstrapJsPath$resourcePath$bootstrapCssPath$bootstrapCssResponsivePath$resourcePath$resourcePath$resourcePath$resourcePath$resourcePath$resourcePath$config.fileId$config.projectId#*							<li>*</li>
